## üìù Notes

1. **Cascade Deletes**: Many relations use `onDelete: Cascade` to maintain referential integrity
2. **Unique Constraints**: Composite unique constraints prevent duplicate enrollments, submissions, etc.
3. **Timestamps**: Most models include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` for audit trails
4. **Arrays**: PostgreSQL arrays used for tags, resources, and options
5. **Text Fields**: `@db.Text` used for potentially large content fields
6. **Indexing**: Consider adding `@@index` for frequently queried fields
